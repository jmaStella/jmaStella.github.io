# Lab 1 Page
### all Header 2 format text are used to check each markdown construct, will be removed afterwards.

## Styling text
**Hello, everyone! Welcome to my ~~beautiful~~ amazing github world! I am so _excited_ for CSE110**



## Quoting text
Don't know who says it, but I really like this quote
>Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.

## quoting code
During the lab 1, I review a lot of git command, like `git add`, `git push`, and `git commit`.

I also learn a lot about markdown, and I feel like this tool is as powerful as html and css.
